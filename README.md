### Scenario 1: Weight (lbs), Leaf Length (mm), and Stalk Length (ft) post test measures Comparison using Student's t-test and Welch t-test for Inferential Analysis. The research group is conducting an experimental study to check whether there is a significant difference between the control and treatment group in the weight (lbs), leaf length (mm), and stalk length (ft) post test measures. Samples for each group were determined via sample size estimation using power and mean, and randomization is considered in the assignment of groups.
